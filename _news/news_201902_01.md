I have a research visit at the [Institute Of Computing Technology](http://english.ict.cas.cn/) of Chinese Academy Of Sciences, hosted by Assoc. Prof. Ying Wang and Assoc. Prof. Cheng Liu. We discussed about the potentional collaborations on distributed machine learning in large data center networks. Also, very glad to visit their amazing startup [Jeejio](http://jeejio.com/en/) in Beijing.

I also have visited [China University of Petroleum-Beijing](http://www.cup.edu.cn/english/) and given a talk there, hosted by Prof. Weifeng Liu, who was a Marie Curie Fellow. We discussed about the joint work on GPU-based process mining.
