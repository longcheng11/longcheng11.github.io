Delighted to announce that I have reconnected to [Insight SFI Research Centre for Data Analytics](https://www.insight-centre.org/) in Ireland as a Visiting Professor.

I will use the opportiunity to participate generally in the scholarly and scientific life of the Insight community and continue my research collaboration with Insight and Insight-related principal investigators.
