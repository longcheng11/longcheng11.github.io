More and more business requirements are crossing organizational boundaries, which makes cross-organization business process management increasing desirable in todayâ€™s business world. However, the lack of mutual trust among different organizations is often a roadblock. Blockchain platforms allow a set of actors to maintain a ledger of transactions without relying on a central authority, and this feature can be used as a basis for executing cross-organization collaborative business processes among mutually untrusting parties. One of the latest work [1] has introduced such a blockchain-based engine with the source code available at [2]. However, the proposed system has one major issue: it complies the whole cross-organization business model into a set of smart contracts. This would be not efficient in terms of system executions. Moreover, the business privacy of each organization is not protected properly [3]. In this project, our target is to develop a privacy-aware cross-organization business process execution engine on the Ethereum blockchain by improving and extending the existing implementation [2] with new features.
